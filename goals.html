                    <h1>Goals!</h1>   
                    <p>Once I graduate there are things I wish to accomplish. My passion is green/sustainable real estate as well as real estate investing. I hope to put all of my energy towards that upon my graduation from the University of Missouri. </p>

                    <p> My goal overall is to be financially free by the age of 30. As well as being able to travel and learn about other cultures. I realized at an early age that I didn't want to sit behind a desk for ever. The plan is, is to grind for a decade as hard as possible in every aspect of my work. To then be able to do what ever it is that I would like it.</p>
