                    <h1> Hi, thanks for vistiting my site.</h1>   

                <p>is my first attempt at creating an html and css website. This website will tell and show you a snipbit of my life so far. Where I started, what I enjoy and where I wish to be in the future. I hope you enjoy the experience. Here's alittle about me. Again, my name is John Segre-Lawrence. I am from Long Island City, Queens. It's a small neighborhood in Queens, NY. While growing up in New York I attended Grace Church School from Kindergarten up until the seventh grade. After that I attended Winston Prepatory School from the eigth grade until I graduated high school. I had alot of trouble at my first school due to my learning disabilities. However, I still believe Grace Church School is a well created school. <a href="https://www.gcschool.org/">Grace Church School</a>. Although I had struggles at Grace, I did sing in the church choir. This allowed me to have a window away from the struggles for a time.</p> 

                <p>Finally, once I began my education at Winston Prepatory School my acedemic success began to form. My grades shot up, I made better friendships, and I finally enjoyed learning. The school is designed for children with learning disabilities which made it a perfect fit for me. Through years of building and hard work I managed to join the forward program. The allowed me to take college courses at NYU during my junior year of high school instead of taking high school level courses. There, I really learnt about myself. I realized that even with learning challenges, it didn't mean I had to live in a box so to speak. While attending Wiston I was also in the debate club and we went on a debate team trip to watch the <i>"2016 presidential inauguration".</i> My time at winston was extremely important for me and I am very happy that I attended the school. <a href="https://www.winstonprep.edu/">check out Winston Prepatory</a> </p>
